# Working with the Canvas API

This is as per Chapter 2 ("The Canvas Drawing API") of ["Advanced Game Design with HTML5 and JavaScript"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Advanced-Game-Design-HTML5-JavaScript/dp/1430258004), by Rex van der Spuy.

## What we've done so far
* Create a canvas element and use the new canvas context to draw some lines.

We're using a line configuration object for each line, specifying different positions and line cap styles for each line.
