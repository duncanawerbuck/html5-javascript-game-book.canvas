# Working with the Canvas API

This is as per Chapter 2 ("The Canvas Drawing API") of ["Advanced Game Design with HTML5 and JavaScript"](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Advanced-Game-Design-HTML5-JavaScript/dp/1430258004), by Rex van der Spuy.

## What we've done so far
* Create a canvas element and create helper functions that allow us to use the new canvas context to:
  * draw some lines
  * draw a complex shape and apply a fill colour
